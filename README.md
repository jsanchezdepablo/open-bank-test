NOTES:
I had to update some libraries as react-scripts since some properties of ECMAScript6 didn't work with old versions of react-scripts.

LANGUAGES:
There are two languages, English and Spanish. To switch between them, it's necessary to change the language of the browser and recharge the web page.
Any different language to spanish will be showed as english.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
